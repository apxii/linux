Rockchip RK3288 EDP interface
================================

Required properties:
- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-edp";

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	clock-names property.
- clock-names: from common clock binding:
	Required elements: "dp"
			"phy"
			"pclk"
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
	See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the name "edp"
- rockchip,grf: phandle to the GRF syscon of the system.

Required nodes:

The lvds has two video ports as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
Their connections are modeled using the OF graph bindings specified in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- video port 0 for the VOP inputs
- video port 1 for a panel as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/panel/simple-panel.txt

Example:
	edp: edp@ff970000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-edp";
		reg = <0xff970000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 98 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_EDP>, <&cru SCLK_EDP_24M>, <&cru PCLK_EDP_CTRL>;
		clock-names = "dp", "phy", "pclk";
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		resets = <&cru 111>;
		reset-names = "edp";
		rockchip,panel = <&panel>;
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			edp_in: port@0 {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				edp_in_vopb: endpoint@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vopb_out_edp>;
				};
				edp_in_vopl: endpoint@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vopl_out_edp>;
				};
			};
			edp_out: port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				edp_out_panel: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
