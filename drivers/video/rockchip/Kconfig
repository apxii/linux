config EDID_BASICTOSVD_GEN2THOMAS_FIX
	bool     "EDID fix by gen2thomas to make all resolutions available"
  help
   This fix ensure that all resolutions from basic EDID block of your display 
   are also available for your device. In case the extended EDID block of your 
   display has some SVD's (short video descriptor) the basic EDID block 
   informations will be lost without this fix.
   
   Background: Some monitors EDID (f.e. acer P225HQL) have no duplicated entry in basic and
   extended block. F.e. the 1920x1080p resolution is only described in the basic EDID block 
   and some other resolutions are available as SVD of the extended EDID block.
   Therefore the 1920x1080p resolution (or possible others) will be lost although the monitor
   would support it.
